I'm R-J Lim, also known as killergerbah on the Internet. I'm a software engineer primarily with experience working on game servers, but I've had the opportunity to build and work on all kinds of user-facing software throughout the years.

Having originally majored in math in college, I love solving problems and exercising the logical part of my brain. I love a good mystery novel. I also have a strong interest language-learning, and as a learner I've achieved an advanced level of Japanese.

I'm currently based in Tokyo.
