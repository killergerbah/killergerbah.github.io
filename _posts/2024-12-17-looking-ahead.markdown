Lately, one cannot help but feel as though the world is becoming a harder place to live in.
Layoffs left and right. All the damages of capitalism and less of the benefits.
If you're in Japan, a stagnating economy. Software engineers especially are taking a big hit.
On the other hand, now more than ever there are resources to work for and develop yourself.

That's why I created this website. Partly as a way to advocate for myself and increase my
chances of survival. And partly because it's always nice to have another avenue for self-expression.
Thanks for reading this, and I hope we get along.
