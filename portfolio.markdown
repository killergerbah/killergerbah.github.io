## Open source software

Below are projects for which I am the chief or sole contributor.

### [asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer){:target="\_blank"}

A popular Chrome extension and browser-based media player with features intended to help serious, tools-savvy language-learners.

### [pgs-parser](https://github.com/killergerbah/pgs-parser){:target="\_blank"}

A BluRay subtitle file parser for the browser. I wrote this to support BluRay subtitle files in asbplayer.

## Video editing

### [Fragic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqyDE1xfqWo){:target="\_blank"}

When I was younger I made a lot of frag videos for an old Quake 3 mod called Urban Terror. This is my last video and the one I'm most proud of.

## Certifications

### JLPT N1

The N1 is the most difficult level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. I passed it with a near-perfect score. Of course, this exam is not a precise representation of real Japanese language Proficiency, but I'm proud of this accomplishment
nonetheless.

## Professional experience

While my focus has been in application servers, I consider myself to be a versatile generalist with experience using a wide breadth of technologies.

### 2025-Present: Limit Break

Working on some pretty cool stuff as a member of an international team.

### 2017-2025: N3TWORK

At N3TWORK I was primarily responsible for designing, building, and operating the backend components of N3TWORK's games as a member of very small teams. We used Java servers backed by DynamoDB and Redis, and used Apache Thrift to communicate with game clients.

#### [Legendary: Heroes Unchained](https://www.legendaryheroesunchained.com){:target="\_blank"}

N3TWORK's foray into web3 gaming using Legendary IP. I was responsible for all of the game's web3 integrations, including the NFT smart contract, user authentication, the open marketplace, and payments.

#### Tetris

Tetris had a realtime component to support various multiplayer game modes, including one that regularly saw traffic of on the order of 10,000 concurrent connections. I took point on many user-facing and non-user-facing systems ranging from matchmaking to deployment of our realtime servers.

#### Legendary: Game of Heroes

A card collector RPG similar to Puzzles and Dragons. I was one of two engineers responsible for the game's backend.

### 2013-2017: Zynga

#### [Zynga Poker](https://zyngapoker.com){:target="\_blank"}

Zynga Poker was one of Zynga's oldest games and featured a very old backend written in PHP and backed by MySQL and Memcached. The poker simulation was implemented using a realtime server written in Java and JavaScript. I was mostly a feature developer but also spent a lot of time working on non-user-facing systems.

## Education

I graduated in 2013 from Stanford University with a BS in mathematics.
